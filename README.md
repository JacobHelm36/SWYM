SWYM interview ReactJS project

## src/App.js file

This project is mostly constructed in the App.js file.  Since learning reactJS took a bit more time than I anticipated I did not necessilarily focus too much on proper file structure. Instead I focused more so on functionality.  There is no backend server as of now, I have another file setup using express, but again since reactJS is new to me, I was having issues getting the front and backend to work together.

## Components

Only added a card, teaching myself React, I didn't feel I had enough time to learn the proper file structure. I assume it is to make components and utilize them in the App.js file.

## General

React is way different than Vue.  Even the bootstrap is different.  I did not make a backend server for it, I couldn't get it to interact the proper way, but I do have one I am working on.  The file reader was difficult to manipulate the CSS for it.
